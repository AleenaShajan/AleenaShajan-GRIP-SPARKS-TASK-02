# GRIP-SPARKS-TASK-02

The objective of the project is to predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually from the given 'Iris Dataset'.

Steps involved in this project:
  1)IMPORTING THE REQUIRED LIBRARIES
  2)LOADING AND READING THE DATASET
  3)FEATURE EXPLORATION
  4)DATA PREPARATION
  5)DATA VISUALIZATION [THE ELBOW METHOD]
  6)FINAL OUTPUT
  7)CONCLUSION
  
  
  INSIGHTS DRWAN FROM THE PROJECT:
  1.By using the elbow method,the best optimum number of clusters are obtained.From the above given elbow plot,3 is the optimum no of clusters obtained.
  2.A Scatter graph has been ploted for the visualization of each clusters and the big yellow circle represents the cetroids of each cluster.
